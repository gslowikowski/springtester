h1. Spring Tester Demo Application

The demo directory provides an example of a Play! application wired up using the @Spring@ module and tested using the @Spring Tester@ module.

To run a build that executes the test, just follow these simple steps:

* Open a terminal

* Go to the @samples-and-tests/demo@ directory

* Run @play deps --sync@ to resolve the dependencies of the demo application

* Run @play auto-test@ to run the test

You can also start up the demo application using the standard @play run@ command.
