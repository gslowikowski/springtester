h1. Spring Tester Demo Application

The demo directory provides an example of a Play! application wired up using the @Spring@ module and tested using the @Spring Tester@ module.

To run a build that executes the test, just follow these simple steps:

* Open a terminal.

* Go to the @samples-and-tests/demo@ directory.

* Run @play deps --sync@ to resolve the dependencies of the demo application.  The @dependencies.yml@ assumes that you have the version number appended to the checkout directory of @springtester@.  Please check that the version number in @dependencies.yml@ matches the @springtester@ checkout directory on your machine.  For example, if the @dependencies.yml@ states that it is using @- springtester -> springtester 0.1@, then your checkout directory needs to be called @springtester-0.1@.

* Run @play auto-test@ to run the test.

You can also start up the demo application using the standard @play run@ command.
