h1. springtester

The @springtester@ module is used in conjunction with the @spring@ module and provides additional classes for injecting mocks/stubs when writing tests for your Play! application.

h2. Getting started

Include @springtester@ in your Play! application by adding the following in your @dependencies.yml@:

bc. - play -> springtester [version]

h2. Usage

The @springtester@ module assumes you are wiring your application using the @spring@ module.  Here is an example of two classes being wired up using the @spring@ module.  The first is a @Person@ class that injects a @BirthCertificate@ and calls the @getAge()@ method:

bc. @Component
public class Person {
    @Resource private BirthCertificate certificate;
    public void age() {
        int age = certificate.getAge();
        System.out.println("The age is " + age);
    }
}

The @BirthCertificate@ returns 10:

bc. @Component
public class BirthCertificate {
    public int open() {
        return 10;
    }
}

Now let's say you want to write a test for @Person@ called @PersonTest@ and wish to replace the @BirthCertificate@ with a mock that returns the age
of 20 instead of 10.
