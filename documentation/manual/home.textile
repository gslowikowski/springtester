h1. springtester

The @springtester@ module is used in conjunction with the @spring@ module and provides additional classes for injecting mocks/stubs when writing tests for
your Play! application.

h2. Getting started

Include springtester in your Play! application by adding the following in your @dependencies.yml@:

bc. - play -> springtester [version]

h2. Usage

The @springtester@ module assumes you are wiring your application using the @spring@ module.  Here is an example of two classes being wired up
using the @spring@ module:

bc. @Component
public class Person {
    @Resource
    private House house;

    public void action() {
        house.open();
    }
}

@Component
public class House {
    public void open() {
        ...
    }
}
